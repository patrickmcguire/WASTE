-- this really should be in platform.h, but oh well :)
ADDED Md5Chap - This should not even be in platform, there should
	be fucking platform base classes where WASTE is built upon.
	There should also be no god damned dependency of data layer code to the gui.
	This makes a full linux port very unhandy..
