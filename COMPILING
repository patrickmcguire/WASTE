wxWASTE builds on GCC or ICC. It has been tested on Linux, and should build on
*BSD, and other POSIX systems.

Short Guide:
------------

Type the following commands to build WASTE:

./configure
make

WASTE will be compiled to an executable named 'waste'.

Long Guide:
-----------

If, for whatever reason, you wish to rebuild the configure script, a script is
provided to execute the autotools programs required. To do this, run the
following commands:

./configure
make

WASTE will be compiled to an executable named 'waste'.

Enjoy.
